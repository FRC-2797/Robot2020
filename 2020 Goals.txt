Goals:

Drivetrain(Mecanum)
	Fast and working
	able to strafe precisely
	PRECISION and SPEED!

	drivetrain in 2020 project
		sparkmax
		neo motors
		encoder values
		navx integrated
		limelight integrated
	auto drive in all directions by navx
	auto yaw via navx
	auto yaw via limelight for target
	auto drive via limelight for distance

	distance sensor integrate
	auto drive via distance sensor


Ball	
	Vision locking onto the hex maybe inner if the team votes 
	Upper(outer)
		Stretch: Inner
	Pickup(floor)
	
	integrate motorcontroller for ball intake
	integrate motorcontroller for ball shooter
	update limelight to see hexagonal target
	get distance from target via limelight
	get angle from limelight
	test if limelight can see ball
		test alternate vision processor (stretch)
	
	

Hanging
	is there a way to auto postion???
	manuvering there
	ways to hang
	Balancing ??

auto
	Need to make plans on what to do during this period(Ball pickup ? Shooting? Bot placement prep for teleop)
	

Stretch Goal: Wheel
	Spinning 3<=X<5
		Encoders to read distance until desired point
	Color Recognition
		Taking in FMS message and going to desired color via color reader? Vision processing?
